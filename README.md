A [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org) slave using JNLP to establish connection.

See [Jenkins Distributed builds](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds) for more info.

Make sure your ECS container agent is [updated](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html) before running. Older versions do not properly handle the entryPoint parameter. See the [entryPoint](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definitions) definition for more information.

## About this fork

This fork of the official image adds the following things to the base image:

 - Installs `sudo` and adds jenkins user to the sudoers. This might be
   a security breach but since this is intended to run in ephemeral containers
   launched by trusted users, we don't care as much.
 - Installs `mysql-server`. Admin username:password = root:root
 - Installs `redis-server` as well as `elasticsearch`.
 - Installs `build-essentials` as well as interpreters and dev packages for:
   - ruby
   - nodejs
   - php 7


## Configuration specifics

By default, JnlpProtocol3 is disabled due to the known stability and scalability issues.
You can enable this protocol on your own risk using the
<code>JNLP_PROTOCOL_OPTS=-Dorg.jenkinsci.remoting.engine.JnlpProtocol3.disabled=false</code> property.

## Running

To run a Docker container

    docker run jenkinsci/jnlp-slave -url http://jenkins-server:port <secret> <slave name>

optional environment variables:

* `JENKINS_URL`: url for the Jenkins server, can be used as a replacement to `-url` option, or to set alternate jenkins URL
* `JENKINS_TUNNEL`: (`HOST:PORT`) connect to this slave host and port instead of Jenkins server, assuming this one do route TCP traffic to Jenkins master. Useful when when Jenkins runs behind a load balancer, reverse proxy, etc.
